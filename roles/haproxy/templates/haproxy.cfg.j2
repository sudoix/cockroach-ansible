    # timeout client and server govern the maximum amount of time of TCP inactivity.

    # execute a query before the first result set record is emitted, or in case of
    # some trouble on the server. So these timeout settings should be larger than the
    # time to execute the longest (most complex, under substantial concurrent workload)
    # query, yet not too large so truly failed connections are lingering too long
    # (resources associated with failed connections should be freed reasonably promptly).
